This means field trips can be exploring ancient and cultural sites, geographical features,cultural events, traditions, living experiences, agricultures, and many more. Students are not only getting to learn on their field trips, but they are also getting to make different memories with their teachers and classmates as well. Field trips act as both learning tools and special treatments for students and teachers at our
